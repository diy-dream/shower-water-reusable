## Summary

The idea of this project is to set up a system for reused the the cold water from the shower. This project is intended for my parents who have tanks to collect rainwater which allows them to supply the toilets with water and also to water the plants in summer.


When we take a shower we wait for the water to get hot, so we are wasting water that could very well be used for something else. So I created a system that allows cold water to be sent to the tubs and to detect / notify when the shower water is ready for the user.
